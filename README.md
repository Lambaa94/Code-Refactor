# Code-Refactor

## I came into this project not knowing a lot about refacting code or using symantic HTML. I now understand how important it is to have descriptive well organized code. I went through many changes where I renamed basic div tags into tags that specified what the contents were and consolidated CSS items that were the same. I made sure that the follows accessibility standards so the page can be clearly read.
