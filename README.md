# Code-Refactor

## Description

### Summary 

 I came into this project not knowing a lot about refacting code or using symantic **html**. I now understand how important it is to have descriptive, well organized code. I went through many changes where I renamed basic div tags into tags that specified what the contents were and consolidated css items that were the same. I made sure that the page follows accessibility standards so it can be clearly read.

### html
 
 I started out changing all generic`<div>` tags to tags that made more sense for me. I added alt= to all img tags to give a description to what the image was. I also changed the tags that incased the copyright from `<p>` to `<small>` as I thought that would be more appropriate. I fixed a navigation link that wasn't working do to an absent id tag. I also created a logo for the title.

### css
 
 I condensed items that were the same code so there wasn't any code that was repeating itself. I moved the main three sections above the aside becuase I thought that it matched more what the **html** page was showing. I went through and made sure any changes I made on the **html** side matched up with **css**.
